# ECSE222, Labs
In a group of 2, we had to complete 3 labs in the course of our semester. Each lab built on each other.

# Programming Language
* VHDL

# Lab 1
Consisted of a simple 14-bit adder with flicker switchers. We had to map the pins and the 7-segment display.

# Lab 2
We had to design a stopwatch that used the on board clock. We created a template then used it for every display. They were connect in series so the end of one would trigger the start of another.

# Lab 3
We designed a state machine that would iterate through all the states. A switch could be flipped in order to change the direction of the state machine.

# Biggest difficulties:
* Debugging in Quartus was nearly impossible. The compiler would tell us there is an error in the project but not tell us where. 
* Designing a simple and efficient circuit required a lot of redos.

# What I learned
* Learned VHDL.
* Basics of digital logic and how to design circuits

Sorry this repo is not in order, it's on my to-do list!
